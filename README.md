# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Python Text Encryption Tool

This is a simple command-line tool that performs encryption and decryption using the **Caesar Cipher** — a basic shift cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## 📚 What is the Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the earliest known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number (known as the **shift value**). 

For example, with a shift of `3`:

## 🧠 Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages using a user-defined shift value
- Handles both **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters
- Keeps **non-letter characters** (spaces, numbers, punctuation) unchanged
- Simple and interactive CLI (Command-Line Interface)

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Save the Python code as `caesar_cipher.py`
2. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, etc.)
3. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved
4. Run the script:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
